## 🎯 Purpose

These diagrams are designed to help with:
- Network topology planning and documentation
- VLAN configuration visualization
- System architecture design
- Workflow and process documentation
- IT infrastructure presentations
- Educational and reference materials

## 📁 Diagram Categories

The repository includes diagrams for various topics such as:
- **Network Topologies**: pfSense, UniFi, VLAN configurations
- **Storage Designs**: Storage architecture and layouts
- **Monitoring Systems**: GrayLog and logging infrastructure
- **DNS & Certificates**: Troubleshooting workflows
- **General Workflows**: Various IT processes and procedures

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Opening Diagrams

1. **Online Editor (Recommended)**
   - Go to [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)

4. Export as needed (PNG, SVG, PDF, etc.)

### Exporting Diagrams

Draw.io supports multiple export formats:
- **PNG** - For web and presentations (with transparency support)
- **SVG** - For scalable vector graphics
- **PDF** - For documentation
- **JPEG** - For general image use
- **XML** - Raw diagram data

## 📝 File Format

All diagrams are saved in `.drawio` format, which is:
- XML-based and human-readable
- Version control friendly
- Compatible with Draw.io web and desktop applications
- Can contain multiple pages/tabs in a single file

## 🎨 Customization Tips

- **Themes**: Many diagrams use the dark theme (#114B5F background)
- **Colors**: Consistent color schemes for different network zones
- **Icons**: Uses standard networking icons and shapes
- **Labels**: Clear labeling for easy understanding
- **Flow**: Uses arrows and connectors to show data flow

## 💡 Best Practices

When creating or modifying diagrams:
- Use consistent color coding for similar components
- Label all connections and interfaces
- Include IP addresses and VLANs where applicable
- Add legends for complex diagrams
- Keep diagrams focused on one concept or system
- Use layers for complex multi-tier architectures
